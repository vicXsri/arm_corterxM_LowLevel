# ARM Cortex‑M Low‑Level Experiments & Debugging Playground

This repository contains a collection of small, focused experiments created to
understand **low‑level ARM Cortex‑M fundamentals**, **debugging techniques**, and **C/C++ language-level concepts** used in bare‑metal embedded development.

Each folder is an isolated micro‑project exploring a single behaviour:
debugging instrumentation (SWV), OpenOCD scripting, inline assembly, ARM architecture
bits (T‑bit, exception behaviour), access levels, and more.

The projects target a Cortex‑M microcontroller (e.g., STM32), but the concepts are
generic to ARMv7‑M / Cortex‑M architectures.
